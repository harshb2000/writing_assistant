# Magic System Test

Alice discovered she had unusual abilities. She could use @power:hardening to make her skin as tough as steel, and @magic:fire to create flames from thin air. 

Her friend Marcus had different gifts - he possessed @skill:lockpicking and @power:telepathy, making him excellent at gathering information.

The ancient artifact they found granted @magic:time manipulation, but it required @skill:meditation to control properly.

Characters with @trait:immortal blood could use @magic:healing without any training, but normal humans needed years of @skill:practice to master even basic spells.
