# Magic System: Stress-Activated Abilities

**World:** In this modern urban fantasy setting, some people develop supernatural abilities when exposed to extreme emotional or psychological stress.

**Magic System:** Abilities are tied to the person's core nature and manifest as enhanced versions of their existing skills or psychological traits.

**Rules:**
1. Powers only activate under genuine stress or threat
2. Abilities reflect the person's essential nature
3. Overuse leads to exhaustion and temporary inability to access powers
4. Most people never realize they have abilities because they avoid high-stress situations

**Known Abilities:**
- @power:hardening - Physical toughening (Alice's ability)
- @power:telepathy - Mental communication (Marcus's ability) 
- @skill:enhanced_intuition - Supernatural pattern recognition
- @power:time_dilation - Subjective time manipulation under pressure

**Technology Integration:** The surveillance algorithms at TechCorp may be designed to identify people with latent abilities by analyzing stress response patterns in their digital behavior.

**Theme:** The magic system explores how people discover hidden strengths when pushed to their limits, and how power structures might exploit these discoveries.
