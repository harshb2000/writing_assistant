## Chapter 1: The Discovery

Alice Chen was having another late night at TechCorp when she stumbled upon something that would change everything. Deep in the company's new analytics codebase, she found algorithms that were doing far more than tracking simple user metricsâ€”they were building detailed psychological profiles of every user.

The implications hit her immediately. This wasn't just a privacy violation; it was digital surveillance on a massive scale. She needed to tell someone, but who could she trust?

Her friend Sarah Kim came to mind. They'd known each other since college, and Sarah had always been the voice of reason. Alice grabbed her phone and sent a quick text: "Emergency coffee at Binary Cafe?"
