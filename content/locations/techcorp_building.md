# TechCorp Building

**Location:** The TechCorp headquarters is a gleaming 40-story glass tower in the heart of Silicon Valley's tech district.

**Architecture:** Modern open-plan design with endless rows of cubicles, ping pong tables, and "collaboration spaces" that somehow make real collaboration harder.

**Atmosphere:** Buzzing with the energy of hundreds of programmers, designers, and product managers. The sound of keyboards clicking, coffee machines brewing, and the occasional frustrated sigh when code doesn't compile.

**Security:** Badge access to all floors, security cameras everywhere (officially for safety, but Alice suspects they're used for much more), and restricted access to the upper floors where executives work.

**Notable Areas:**
- **The Pit:** Nickname for the main floor where junior developers work
- **Server Farm:** Basement levels with the company's computing infrastructure
- **Executive Floor:** Top floors with corner offices and actual privacy

**Secret:** Hidden in the server logs are the surveillance algorithms that Alice discovered, running parallel data collection far beyond what users consented to.
