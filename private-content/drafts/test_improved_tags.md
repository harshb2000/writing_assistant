# Test Story with Smart Tags

@character:Soren walked through the @location:Forest with his brother @character:Saran. They were hunting for food in the @location:Unnamed_Village area.

Soren had @power:enhanced_hearing which helped him detect the @animal:forest_rabbit nearby. His brother Saran possessed @skill:tracking_ability that complemented Soren's powers perfectly.

The @theme:brotherhood was strong between them as they worked together in the dangerous @location:Dark_Woods where @animal:shadow_wolves were known to prowl.
